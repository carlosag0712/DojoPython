My name is Carlos and I'm PM / Scrum Master originally from Panama, but joining out of Toronto,ON,Canada.
I've always been passionate about coding. However, when I started my career in Panama, I got the chance to jump straight into PM'ing
reason why I never had the joy to code on the job.

10 years later (I started my PM career right out of Grad School in '07) and after growing and taking more and more
complex projects I realized that that the whole "A PM doesn't need to be technical" mantra is running its course... let me be
blunt, IT IS DYING... my estimation is that in 3-5 years there will be very little room for Non Tech PM/SM's in the software
development biz/scene.

I've been challenged with extremely complex initiatives in which technical leadership is of the essence.

Not to mentioned Google and Amazon leading the Technical Project/Program Manager trend in which you are required to code
on the interview.

My goals:

I have a couple of short term projects, but I prefer to show them off when I'm done rather than jinx it :P
One thing I want to do is code along with my team, be one of the guys and not just the guy driving the timeline and asking
for updates...  :(

another dream of mine is to code plugins for JIRA / CONFLUENCE. I have really cool ideas that I know will be very helpful
to the PM/SM  community.
